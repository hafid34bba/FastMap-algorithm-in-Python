# FastMap-algorithm-in-Python
FastMap: a fast algorithm for indexing, data-mining and visualization of traditional and multimedia datasets

FastMap is a new fast algorithm for mapping objects into points in some k-dimensional space.
It is inspired by dimension reduction methods such as PCA and SVD while also being applicable to arbitrary metric spaces.

Goals:	1. efficient mapping of N given objects (N is large)
      	2. efficient retrieval of data
